                    <strong><a href="https://www.dal.ca/" target="_blank">Dalhousie University</a></strong>in Nova Scotia, Canada. My goals include becoming a<strong>game
                    developer,</strong>and working with frontend developemnt. I also have an interest in the
                    developemnt of<strong>AI</strong>and<strong>robotics,</strong> and would like to become familiar with their
                    workings. I've always been interested in computers and how person to computer
                    interaction is developed. I love using my<strong>creativity</strong>and programming knowledge to
                    design and bring ideas to life. Learning new things is a big part of my life, whether
                    it's a new programming language, or a new song on the drums. I consider myself a
                    <strong>fast learner,</strong>as I quickly catch on to core concepts and obsorb information
                    <em>effeciently</em>and<em>effectively.</em>

                    Music has been a big part of my life as It allows me to<em>express myself</em>and<em>connect with others.</em>It provides me
                    with an outlet to be<strong>creative,</strong>and hopefully, inspire. I am currently in a new band called<strong>Fortune House,</strong>with
                    my brother Thomas on bass. Hes also studying computer science, and is increadible on both guitar and bass. We
                    share many similar interests, including our taste in music, which allows our songwriting to<em>flow,</em>sometimes with
                    no communication needed. With just drums and bass, we have a lot of space to fill, so our sound is very<strong>punchy,</strong>
                    while giving space to<em>experiment</em>with different sounds and genres. Below is a demo of one of our newer
                    songs<strong>Out of Luck.</strong><br><br><hr></td>
